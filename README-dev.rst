Style
-----

Several style guides for R code can be found on the internet, but
sadly, there is no agreement on how functions, parameters and
variables should be named.  After some consideration, I decided to
follow the majority choice of packages on CRAN, as reported by Rasmus
Bååth's article `The State of Naming Conventions in R`_.  Thus, The
convention I use now is:

  - ``lowerCamelCase`` for function names, and
  - ``period.separated`` for variable names and parameter names.

Except for this convention, I try to follow Google's `R Style Guide`_.
